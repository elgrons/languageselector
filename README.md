#### Programming Language Suggester made for my Independent Code Review during my second week of Epicodus Programming School.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Description

A website that hosts a Programming Language Suggester webpage that asks a person a series of questions and suggests a language to learn based on the answers. This is for the Indpendent Code Review project in my second week of Epicodus programming school and focuses specfically on forms, branching, and Web APIs.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repository to your desktop from Github.com
* Open languageselector.html in your web browser.
* Answer the questions to find out the recommended programming language for you to learn!

If you had feed back or questions email: eliot.lauren@gmail.com

## Known Bugs

* The "let= form..." variable delcaration is in mutliple eventListeners. I did this because I was getting console errors, but I think it is code cluttering and unnesssecary. I'm unsure how to debug, as the functionality is working as intended.
* More questions could always be added!
