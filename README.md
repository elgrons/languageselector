# Programming Language Selector

#### By Eliot Gronstal

#### Programming Language Suggester made for my Independent Code Review during my second week of Epicodus Programming School.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Description

A website that hosts a Programming Language Suggester webpage that asks a person a series of questions and suggests a language to learn based on the answers. This is for the Indpendent Code Review project in my second week of Epicodus programming school and focuses specfically on forms, branching, and Web APIs.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repository to your desktop from Github.com
* Open languageselector.html in your web browser.
* Answer the questions to find out the recommended programming language for you to learn!

If you had feed back or questions email: eliot.lauren@gmail.com

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* Absolutely no functionality yet, TBD
* Radio buttons are a nice idea, but perhaps not my finest choice for this project as they are not working within my javascript code
* More questions could always be added!
